When searching for a place to dock for one side, don't consider areas that have
already been docked to.  Only one form should be able to dock to a region at a
time.

We can't simply use Rectangle to represent docking regions, as the regions may
be broken up as specified above.  So we could use orthogonal line-segments
instead.

When docking, we should never dock if the sides don't intersect with the same
perpendicular plane (allowing for the snapping offset).

Each dockable form should keep track of who it is docked to on each side.
It could possibly be docked to more than one form on one side (in the future).
When a form is moved or resized, all of the forms that are docked to it should update.

Make uxWorkspace resize to fit inside MainForm when it resizes.

Handle the Resize event in DockableForm and make it clamp the form inside the Owner (which is uxWorkspace).
Also update the anchor points and any child forms of uxWorkspace when it resizes.
